# Eclipse Vert.x Kotlin sample project

This is a sample project for how you can set up a
[multi-project Gradle build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html)
using [Vert.x](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x)
and [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin).
You can copy or fork this project to quickly set up a
new project with the same multi-project Gradle structure.

This project consists of a runnable REST API using Vert.x.

## Usage
Clone the project to your local machine, go to the root directory and use:
```
./gradlew api:run
```
This will start the project using an in-memory H2 database.

### Docker Compose
To run the project with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), go to the root directory and use:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will launch the project using a PostgreSQL database.

### Swagger Documentation
Once the system is running, navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger
to view the Swagger documentation.

## Gradle best practices for Kotlin
[docs.gradle.org](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/performance.html) - [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-best-practices.html)

### ✅ Use Kotlin DSL
This project uses Kotlin DSL instead of the traditional Groovy DSL by
using **build.gradle.kts** files instead of **build.gradle** files.
The benefit here is that we do not need to use another programming
language (Groovy) and can simply use Kotlin in our **build.gradle.kts** files.
This gives us the benefits of strict typing which lets IDEs provide
better support for refactoring and auto-completion.

Kotlin DSL over Groovy DSL, you can check out
[gradle-kotlin-dsl-vs-groovy-dsl](https://github.com/thorlauridsen/gradle-kotlin-dsl-vs-groovy-dsl)

### ✅ Use a version catalog

This project uses a version catalog
[local.versions.toml](gradle/local.versions.toml)
which allows us to centralize dependency management.
We can define versions, libraries, bundles and plugins here.
This enables us to use Gradle dependencies consistently across the entire project.

Dependencies can then be implemented in a specific **build.gradle.kts** file as such:
```kotlin
implementation(local.spring.boot.starter)
```

The Kotlinlang article says to name the version catalog **libs.versions.toml**
but for this project it has been named **local.versions.toml**. The reason
for this is that we can create a shared common version catalog which can
be used across Gradle projects. Imagine that you are working on multiple
similar Gradle projects with different purposes, but each project has some
specific dependencies but also some dependencies in common. The dependencies
that are common across projects could be placed in the shared version catalog
while specific dependencies are placed in the local version catalog.

### ✅ Use local build cache

This project uses a local
[build cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)
for Gradle which is a way to increase build performance because it will
re-use outputs produced by previous builds. It will store build outputs
locally and allow subsequent builds to fetch these outputs from the cache
when it knows that the inputs have not changed.
This means we can save time building

Gradle build cache is disabled by default so it has been enabled for this
project by updating the root [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) file:
```properties
org.gradle.caching=true
```

This is enough to enable the local build cache
and by default, this will use a directory in the Gradle User Home
to store build cache artifacts.

### ✅ Use configuration cache

This project uses
[Gradle configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html)
and this will improve build performance by caching the result of the
configuration phase and reusing this for subsequent builds. This means
that Gradle tasks can be executed faster if nothing has been changed
that affects the build configuration. If you update a **build.gradle.kts**
file, the build configuration has been affected.

This is not enabled by default, so it is enabled by defining this in
the root [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) file:
```properties
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true
org.gradle.configuration-cache.parallel=true
```

### ✅ Use modularization

This project uses modularization to create a
[multi-project Gradle build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html).
The benefit here is that we optimize build performance and structure our
entire project in a meaningful way. This is more scalable as it is easier
to grow a large project when you structure the code like this.

```
root
│─ build.gradle.kts
│─ settings.gradle.kts
│─ apps
│   └─ api
│       └─ build.gradle.kts
│─ modules
│   ├─ model
│   │   └─ build.gradle.kts
│   └─ persistence
│       └─ build.gradle.kts
```

This also allows us to specifically decide which Gradle dependencies will be used
for which subproject. Each subproject should only use exactly the dependencies
that they need.

Subprojects located under [apps](apps) are runnable, so this means we can
run the **api** project to spin up a Spring Boot REST API. We can add more
subprojects under [apps](apps) to create additional runnable microservices.

Subprojects located under [modules](modules) are not independently runnable.
The subprojects are used to structure code into various layers. The **model**
subproject is the most inner layer and contains domain model classes and this
subproject knows nothing about any of the other subprojects. The purpose of
the **persistence** subproject is to manage the code responsible for
interacting with the database. We can add more non-runnable subprojects
under [modules](modules) if necessary. This could for example
be a third-party integration.

#### Subproject with other subproject as dependency

The subprojects in this repository may use other subprojects as dependencies.

In our root [settings.gradle.kts](settings.gradle.kts) we have added:
```kotlin
enableFeaturePreview("TYPESAFE_PROJECT_ACCESSORS")
```
Which allows us to add a subproject as a dependency in another subproject:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(projects.model)
}
```

This essentially allows us to define this structure:

```
api
│─ model
└─ persistence

persistence
└─ model

model has no dependencies
```
